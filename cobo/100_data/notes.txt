<OutOfBreath>'s CSV FLOW:
Did not get to that part

Compiling the jar file was a huge headache. first it didn't work, then by changing litereally nothing it started working, then it just stopped working
also could not find core.data* library. Ran into many errors that way


On home computer worked very well, on school computers did not work at all because 1. could not find core library and did not want to cooperate and compile the files

Very jankey, the same code would not always work the same way. Randomly failing
