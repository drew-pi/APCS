Activity 1:
1a. public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b. This method requires a String input, if you do not input a String it will throw an error (incorrect type)
1c. This method returns whatever value comes from "sentiment.get(word.toLowerCase())" or a 0, if that fails. The return type is double.

2.
sentimentalVal("accidental") -> -2.07
sentimentalVal("account") -> 0.64
sentimentalVal("acceptable") -> -0.12

3a. This one would compile because you're inputing the correct type into the method and the variable being filled by the method call is the correct type (sentimentalVal always returns a double)
3b. It would not compile because the input type is a double, not the required String type. And word, the variable being filled up by the method call is the wrong type, so it would not work.
3c. The input types are correct, and the variable taking the value of the method call is correct, however there are too many inputs which will result in an error.
