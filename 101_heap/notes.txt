HW101: Heap o'Trouble

DISCO:
min heap is a heap where the SMALLEST value is the root, goes from small (at the top) to big at the bottom,

seems pretty useless since two children nodes not required to have a sorted data structure - better to use a sorted linked list


QCC:
What is this used for, seems like such a random data structure
