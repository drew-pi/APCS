QCC
Faster, but more memory?
    - Thinking: Doesn't it take a lot of memory to create so many tiny arrays, for an array of length n, you would have to create an n number of 1 item arrays 


DISCO
Faster when more people doing it, not just one director



FIRMWARE

When given a deck: 
1. Divide deck in two (based on just eyeballing it)
2. Give deck to two people

When only have one card / sorted cards
1. Find the person who gave it to you 
2. Give them your card

When given card(s)
1. Sort the card into your deck by using our merge algo
2. Give your cards to the person that gave them to you
