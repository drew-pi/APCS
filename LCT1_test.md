#### Do Now
 - Take out hardcopy of HW 31 out
 - Greatest number Thinker, login
#### On Board
 - ```$ git clone <SSH CLONE URL>```
 - ```$ cd repository``` (into what you just cloned)
 - ```$ git pull``` (whenever you need refresh)
#### Questions at the beginning of class
 - *Analog Feedback*
    - How did you feel about HW#31?
       - Most people seemed happy with it
 - *Binary Feedback*
    - Who saw Jayleen's QAF post?
#### On HW grades ([Piazza Post](https://piazza.com/class/kue5pmk0w7n70n?cid=215))
 - Sadly Brook's HW server was disbanded
 - Pupil path sucks
 - *Can post HW on Piazza after it was due*
    - Make sure to check with your group first though!
    - **Note**
      - When looking at the solutions posted (by Students or Mr. Mykolyk), don't think that the solution posted is the only way to do it
      - Make sure to read and understand the code because that is a very important skill

#### Class work
 - Reshuffling
    - Person logged in is X (greatest number Thinker)
    - X - 1 goes to team + 4
    - X - 2 goes to team + 5
 - Class Work
    - X pulls and runs Mr. Mykolyk's working solution to [Pig.java](https://github.com/ap251/library/blob/main/31_oink/Pig.java) using terminal code on the white board
    - Look for things that stood out 
    - **QAF Post's**
      - TNPG Umm post about hasAVowel 
      - Recommended we respond to [Jayleen's QAF post](https://piazza.com/class/kue5pmk0w7n70n?cid=226)
    - Visualize commafy solution posted in library yourself on a paper and then paste it into an [online Visualier](https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit) linked in the homepage

#### General Concerns 
 - *Stack Diagrams*
   - Many people wrote (in their QCC) that they didn't know how to draw Stack diagrams
   - Looked at a Recursive Stack diagram
      - If anyone has one that they are proud of maybe post to QAF
   - Discussed why Scheme/ Dr.Racket asked for memory when doing recursion in Intro
      - Because manages memory differently than Java

#### End of Class
 - Had some options
   - Study
   - Visualize Commafy solution in library repository
   - Trace/understand engToPig method in Pig.java

#### Prepare for relaxation day tomorrow!
 - Study for the test 
   - Some suggestions on what to study [here](https://piazza.com/class/kue5pmk0w7n70n?cid=226)
 - Good Luck!
