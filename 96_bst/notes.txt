Let the computer do the work. Just like knights tour, don't think just outsource all the work to children, just like how our shoes get made :)

QCC:
Does the first insert create the root or should the root be a fixed value?
What to do if the value already exists in tree?

In our height method we have to do minus 1 at the end because we initialize our tree with 0.

L = level   d = depth   h = height

1. a perfect binary tree has (2^d) + 1 nodes?
2. At each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^L nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is log(n+1) - 1? Same as perfect tree?



From Gabriel Thompson
1. a perfect binary tree has 2^L - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is Ceiling( log_2(n + 1) ) - 1
