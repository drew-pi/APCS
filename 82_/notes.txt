Having a nested class makes stuff pretty easy, just good for organizing. Still don't understand why they can't be the same class in general,
(for this case I understand why, because need to have something independent from the actual class to have a wide range of things implement it)

Generally not too difficult, but only error that I got stuck on was the one where the method has to return an object of type T, and didn't 
know how to do that without returning something random 
 - you cant initialize a type T
- and you can't just return it, so had to use something else random like getCargo of dummy node
