Generic is very simple to code, you just have to change everything to a place holder (T or other letter/word) and then object
everywhere else because you can only add a new node through the use of the LList, so it makes sure that all of the objects
are correct

Use find and replace a lot.

Cool new syntax Object<Type> (type is the place holder that you can use in the code - can initialize variables using T and type
cast things to T)
