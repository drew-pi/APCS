todo list

0. Create the interface to know which methods to add
1. First add all instance variables (use a linked list called data)
2. then add all necessary/fundamental methods
  - enqueueFront(), enqueueEnd(), dequeueFront(), dequeueEnd()
3. then add other methods that we used in Queue peekFront() and peekEnd()
4. then add other methods inherited from the collection interface such as isEmpty() and size()


Will use a LinkedList to hold the deque
