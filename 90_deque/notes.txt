HW90: Swabbing the Deque
2022-04-12
time spent:  20min



QCC:
What are Queue's and Deque's used for, stacks are used to control the flow of operations in programming languages for example. 



DISCO: Using a linked list was so easy. Just use already built in functionality. And I know how LinkedLists work so I know the run
time for everything and understand how everything works.

When we first started using LinkedLists I didn't realize what they could be useful for, but now I sort of understand. Can use them to
create other data types and not actually store information important to use (like an list of needed information like passwords or words)
    - like the conventional list I mean



In the middle of development decided to just extend our old Queue interface since it already has half of the functionality, so had to
change the names of some of the methods in our LLDeque class and remove some stuff from Deque interface

Also removed size because don't use it anyways, LinkedList takes care of it for us
