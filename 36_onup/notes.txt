HW 36 -- All Quacked Up/How to debug like a boss/Read a section from Think Java that described basic strategies for debugging and getting out of the 
coding gutters 
2021-11-19
time spent: 40min


Main Idea - DEBUGGING IS INFINITELY EASIER THE SMALLER YOUR PROBLEM IS.


Different types of errors
1. compile-time errors
2. run time errors
3. logic errors (program didn't do what we wanted it to do)


Should not listen to compilers advice, should instead try to read the actual error and understand what happened and where in the code.

Types of run time errors
1. infinite loop - use print statements to see if it ever exits loop or something else wrong
		 - can also use print statements to keep track of variables used in loop Boolean expressions

2. Infinite recursion - no base case, or base case doesn't work
3. Flow of execution - if youâ€™re not sure what is happening print out when methods are called and with what inputs


Exceptions
NullPointerException - current variable is null, cannot assign things to it yet
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - see this one a lot, index is either -1 or greater than last index
StackOverflowError - recursion goes on forever
FileNotFoundException - code could not find file referenced in code
ArithmeticException - math error like dividing by 0



Other tips - simplify code with intermediatory variables to show what is happening
	   - Walk away from computer or go to sleep/take a shower, helps to distract yourself for some time
	   - talk to rubber ducky (called rubber ducking) or talk to person/ have them look over code

When you find a bug finally think about why it happened and what you can do to not make that mistake next time.
Think about it some more, don't just correct it and move on.
