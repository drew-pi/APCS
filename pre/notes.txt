This task was very time consuming but in the end I figured it out.

Problems and solutions when creating ssh key on windows:

First problem I encountered was not having git/git bash installed on my computer.
The solution was to install it from the web.

My next issue was that my anti virus detected a virus in git bash which was a false alarm.
So the solution was to quiet my anti virus.


Problems and solutions when commiting changes to github from git:

First problem was that my email wasn't working so I had to follow the on screen commands to configure my email on git on my machine.

Next I couldn't figure out how to open a directory from git bash because it had parentheses and a space. 
So to fix that I just right clicked on the folder and choosing to open with git bash and it worked.


It was painful but in the end I did it.
